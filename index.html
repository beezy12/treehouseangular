        <!-- for ng-class you pass in an object, where the key is the class you want
            to apply. the second part (editing) is the condition you are evaluating, if
            it is true then you apply the editing.item class to the element, which can
            be found in the css. all it does is add some top margin to the save, edit,
            delete if in edit mode-->

               open ng-inspector and watch as a variable is created as you type in the input.
               we then changed it to todo.name. and you can watch in ng-inspector as todo is the object
               and name is the key -->
