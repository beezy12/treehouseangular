        <!-- for ng-class you pass in an object, where the key is the class you want
            to apply. the second part (editing) is the condition you are evaluating, if
            it is true then you apply the editing.item class to the element, which can
            be found in the css. all it does is add some top margin to the save, edit,
            delete if in edit mode-->
            <!-- so for the second ng-class evaluation, look below at the input. it has
            an ng-change, if that input changes (if you edit it), it then sets
            todo.edited to true. then here, if todo.edited is true, it applies the
            'edited' class....which just puts the word 'edited' on the page next to the
            input box -->
        <div class="item" ng-class="{'editing.item': editing, 'edited': todo.edited}" ng-repeat="todo in todos">

               <!-- ng-model binds this inputs value to an object on the scope. the todo object.
               open ng-inspector and watch as a variable is created as you type in the input.
               we then changed it to todo.name. and you can watch in ng-inspector as todo is the object
               and name is the key -->
               <!-- ng-show shows the inputs contents if editing is true down below. notice
               above that ng-hide hides stuff while editing is true -->
               <!-- ng-blur fires when the input box loses focus -->
               <!-- ng-change watches an input for changes and evaluates an expression
               when something has changed. adds the edited word next to an input when
               it has been edited.-->
            <input ng-change="todo.edited = true" ng-blur="editing = false" ng-show="editing" ng-model="todo.name" class="editing-label" type="text"/>

            <div class="actions">
                <!-- look at ng-inspector to see how the editing is toggled. notice the ng-hide
                around that hide their content based on whether editing is true or false. -->
